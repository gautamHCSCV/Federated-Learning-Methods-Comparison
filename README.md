Weutilize the Adversarial Model Perturbations (AMP) regularizer to regularize clientsâ€™ models. The AMP regulzaizer is based on perturbing the model parameters so as to get a more generalized model. The claim of AMP regularizer is to reach flat minima and therefore is expected to reach flat minima in FL settings as well.
